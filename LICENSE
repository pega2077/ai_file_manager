AiFileManager Dual Licensing Policy

Summary:
AiFileManager is available under a dual licensing model, designed to support both open source use and commercial needs. The license terms depend on the size and nature of your organization and your intended use.

Eligibility:
* Individuals and organizations with 15 or fewer people (including all direct and indirect users) may use AiFileManager under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3).
* Organizations with more than 15 people, or anyone wishing to avoid AGPLv3 obligations, must obtain a commercial license.

"15 or fewer people" means the total number of individuals who can access, use, or benefit from AiFileManager, including developers, testers, operators, end-users, and anyone using integrated systems.

1. AGPLv3 License (Open Source)

If you qualify under the "15 or fewer people" rule, you may freely use, modify, and share AiFileManager under the AGPLv3. The full license text is available at: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html

Important: If you modify AiFileManager and make it available to others (for example, as a network service or by distributing your changes), you must also provide the complete source code under AGPLv3. If you do not wish to meet this requirement, please contact us for a commercial license.

2. Commercial License

Required for:
* Organizations with more than 15 users.
* Any user or organization who cannot or does not wish to comply with AGPLv3 (such as source code sharing, copyleft, or other requirements).

Typical cases needing a commercial license:
* You want to keep your modifications private or closed source.
* You plan to offer AiFileManager as a service (SaaS) without releasing your changes.
* Your company policies or contracts prohibit AGPLv3 or require additional legal assurances.

Commercial licenses provide exemptions from AGPLv3 obligations and may include additional terms. 

3. Contributing

We welcome contributions! All code or documentation submitted to AiFileManager is licensed under AGPLv3 for the benefit of the project and its users, including those with commercial licenses.

By contributing, you agree your work may be included in both open source and commercial versions of AiFileManager.

4. Additional Terms

Commercial license terms are defined in a separate agreement signed by both parties.

The AiFileManager team may update this licensing policy as needed. Changes will be announced via official channels (such as the repository or website).
